## Requirements

You can compile assembly parts of this code using WinAPE's maxam assembler. For the Locomotive BASIC parts, there is no need to compile them: they have to be copied to a BASIC program using the emulator (Autotype function).

For overscan image conversions, you may use [ConvImgCpc v0.17](http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/ConvImgCPC) by Ludovic Deplanque. For generating and manipulating the DSK, you may use [ManageDsk v0.20](http://www.cpcwiki.eu/index.php/ManageDsk), also by Ludovic Deplanque. Finally, for compression you may use [Zenith II](http://www.genesis8bit.com/frontend/file/zenith2.lzh) by Xavier Nicolay.
